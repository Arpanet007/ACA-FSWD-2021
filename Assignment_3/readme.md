# Description :-
Learnt the basics of Javascript (JS ES6)
We made:-
1.)A javascript file which  contained all the necessary functions required to make the HTTP requests to the different endpoints of the server and it displayed the returned data on the HTML page.

2.)One HTML file-This HTML file will provide a user interface to a user to make the different requests and view the data returned. It will contain mostly buttons and input fields. For example for the /register endpoint, there should be 3 input fields in the HTML page like 'Name', 'Data', 'Token' and a submit button. When a user fills in the details and clicks the submit button, the javascript part should make a request to the server with all the necessary information and display the result to the user.
